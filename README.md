# akatsuki-Ingenious2021
'Ingenious 2021 Virtual Hackathon' being organized by ISA VIT Pune Student Section on the way !!, Our problem statement for this Hackathon is to build a inhome autonomous robot with 6 dof arm and rgbd cam for helping humans at home ---- Akatsuki was our team name



As there is a Roomba robot for autonomous house floor cleaning. It does not support enough technology to help humans in day to day activities like bringing an object ( be it an apple form kitchen to living room ) to the owner in another room, or taking dishes from dining table to the sink when ever told so. Or reminding the medicine schedule whenever they are supposed to take it. Or to entertain children or old age people in our house . To sum up there is no helper robot for housing which is affordable to the typical Indian house. We as in our team, intend to change that, we are in pursuit of building a autonomous in-house navigation robot with a 6 d-o-f robotic arm for manipulation and object pick and place and RGBD camera for perception and scene understanding with object detection algorithms, and voice control for ease of human interaction with the robot.
